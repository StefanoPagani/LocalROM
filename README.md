## LocalROM: MATLAB(R) scripts for the numerical approximation of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo membrane model using local reduced-order models

LocalROM has been developed at [MOX-Politecnico di Milano](https://mox.polimi.it) under the support of the [iHEART project](http://iheart.polimi.it). It includes straightforward implementations of the local reduced-order models presented in the submitted article:
>[**[PMQ18] S. Pagani, A. Manzoni, A. Quarteroni. Numerical approximation of parametrized problems in cardiac electrophysiology by a local reduced basis method**, submitted to CMAME, 2018.]
