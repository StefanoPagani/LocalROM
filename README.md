## LocalROM: MATLAB(R) scripts for the efficient solution of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo membrane model using local reduced-order models

LocalROM has been developed at [MOX-Politecnico di Milano](https://mox.polimi.it) under the support of the [iHEART project](http://iheart.polimi.it). It includes straightforward implementations of the local reduced-order models presented in the submitted article:
